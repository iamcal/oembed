    notes: |
      In addition to all required and optional OEmbed parameters for
      video content, uStudio supports "autoplay" and "share"
      parameters, which may be set to "true" to enable autoplay or
      share links. If "ignore_aspect_ratio" parameter is set to "true"
      and "maxwidth" and "maxheight" are both provided, the embed code
      will exactly fill the max width and height, ignoring the aspect
      ratio of the video being embedded.
